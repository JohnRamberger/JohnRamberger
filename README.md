# 👋 Hi, I’m @JohnRamberger
Hi, my I'm @JohnRamberger and I'm a first-year student at the Georgia Institute of Technology studying Computer Science. 
# 👀 I’m interested in ...
I'm interested in just about every field related to CS, but I've only dabbled in a few parts such as web development and CLIs among some others. I believe web development is the future, so I try to make everything using HTML/JS/PHP.
# 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
I'm currently learning to use a couple of machine learning platforms exploring data science. There is also a TON of different things that I would love to learn in the future, but sadly I don't have the time right now.
# 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
Anything! I've worked solo on every project of mine, so working with others would be a great experience. 
# 📫 How to reach me ...
You can reach me at jramberger3@gatech.edu for anything you may need me for.
